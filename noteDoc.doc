    Step 1 - Question 2
    Array	    Insert	        Append
extraLargeArray	947.175895 ms	3.792129 ms
largeArray	    7.243 ms	    619.589 μs
mediumArray	    163.727 μs	    156.49 μs
smallArray	    51.298 μs	    107.425 μs
tinyArray	    36.74 μs	    92.184 μs

    Results for the extraLargeArray
    insert 947.175895 ms
    append 3.792129 ms

    Step 1 - Question 3
    Results for the largeArray
    insert 7.243 ms
    append 619.589 μs

    Results for the mediumArray
    insert 163.727 μs
    append 156.49 μs

    Results for the smallArray
    insert 51.298 μs
    append 107.425 μs

    Results for the tinyArray
    insert 36.74 μs
    append 92.184 μs

    Step 1 - Question 4
    The pattern I see is that the smaller the array the quicker the functions run. The append functions has better scaling because as you increase the size of the array it is more constant in the size that it goes up. The insert function time goes up more exponentially.

    Step 1 - Question 5 - Extra Credit
    unshift() increments all of the elements that are already in the array. push() just inserts an element at the end of the array, so it doesnt need to change the elements index.
